This file just has the general conduct when contributing to Power\+Blocks.

TL;DR don\textquotesingle{}t steel code and be mature.\hypertarget{md_docs_2_c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{General Tone}{General Tone}}\label{md_docs_2_c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md4}
In general be civil. Keep discussion related to Power\+Blocks.

Don\textquotesingle{}t be afraid to say I am wrong. You can call me out on my BS, and I will call you out on your BS.

Just try to be agreeable, you don\textquotesingle{}t have to name call or ad hominem go after people with dramatic comments. Just be to the point and constructive.

Provided reasoned responses and counter arguments where needed.\hypertarget{md_docs_2_c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Post Your Stuff}{Post Your Stuff}}\label{md_docs_2_c_o_d_e___o_f___c_o_n_d_u_c_t_autotoc_md5}
Definitely with wii homebrew, be careful to post only your own original code. Don\textquotesingle{}t copy in code or documentation from SDKs.

When implementing functions from other code bases, just make sure that your code is unique, adds value, and is not a direct derivate work.

This also includes other media like 3D models and audio.
