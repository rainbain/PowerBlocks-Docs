This file outlines the expectations for contributing to Power\+Blocks. ~\newline
 The goal is simple\+: keep the project healthy, original, and enjoyable to work on.\hypertarget{code_of_conduct_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{General Tone}{General Tone}}\label{code_of_conduct_autotoc_md0}
Be civil, stay on-\/topic, and respect others’ time and effort.

We can disagree, and you are absolutely allowed to tell me when I\textquotesingle{}m wrong — I’ll do the same when needed. ~\newline
 Just keep feedback constructive and centered on the work, not the person.

Avoid insults, drama, or personal attacks. ~\newline
 Direct, honest and open communication is welcome; hostility is not.

Put effort into your discussions. ~\newline
 Thoughtful questions and reasoned responses help everyone understand each other and make better decisions. \hypertarget{code_of_conduct_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Original Work Only}{Original Work Only}}\label{code_of_conduct_autotoc_md1}
Power\+Blocks is an original SDK. To protect both contributors and the project\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only submit {\bfseries{your own code}}.
\item Do {\bfseries{not}} copy code, assets, or documentation from commercial SDKs or proprietary sources.
\item When re-\/implementing functionality that exists elsewhere, make sure your code is\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item original ~\newline

\item your own interpretation ~\newline

\item not a line-\/for-\/line derivative ~\newline

\item adding value beyond the source ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Avoid referencing other codebases directly while implementing; focus on understanding the behavior and creating your own solution.

This also applies to non-\/code assets such as 3D models, audio, documentation, and examples.

We want Power\+Blocks to stay legally safe, clean, and something everyone can confidently use.
