First I want to say thank you for contributing!

This page contains documents to help assist with contributing to Power\+Blocks.

The general hope is to make Power\+Blocks a strong and powerful SDK for the Wii, so contributions are much welcome.\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Code of Conduct}{Code of Conduct}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md5}
All contributes follow under the code of conduct. Its nothing too crazy but do check it out in the {\ttfamily CODE\+\_\+\+OF\+\_\+\+CONDUCT.\+md} file.\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{How can I contribute?}{How can I contribute?}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md6}
Contributes can be as simple as fixing bug request, making a feature more extendable, or even adding your own block!

Just fork it, make your changes, and submit a PR. I will do my best to review it, provide relevant feedback, and hopefully merge it.

Testing is also much appreciated, just letting me know what works on hardware and does not.

Again think you for your contribution!\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Project Structure}{Project Structure}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md7}
Power\+Blocks is organized into blocks.

The core block is everything the SDK needs to operate as a SDK. This includes hardware access and some coverage of all hardware multi media on the system like video and audio.

Blocks add features every users will need, but are tools that should be implemented within the SDK. Like libraries, interfacing with obscure hardware addons, and more.\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Style Guide}{Style Guide}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md8}
\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Header Files}{Header Files}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md9}
Each header file has a Doxygen compatible comment block. This is expected on the core block, as well as additional blocks.

Most functions and any other relevant parts to using the header should also have the same documentation.\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Naming Convention}{Naming Convention}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md10}
Functions are named like {\ttfamily module\+\_\+action\+\_\+description} and {\ttfamily ios\+\_\+settings\+\_\+initialize.}

Definitions and constants are named with {\ttfamily ALL\+\_\+\+CAPS\+\_\+\+WITH\+\_\+\+UNDERSCORES}. like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{static}\ \textcolor{keyword}{const}\ \textcolor{keywordtype}{char}*\ NAME\ =\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}VALUE"{}};}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Formatting}{Formatting}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md11}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 4 spaces (not tabs.)
\item Opening braces on the same line.
\item Keep lines under \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}100 characters.
\item At least 1 blank line between functions.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Testing}{Testing}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md12}
Make sure to include the test of your contributions when it changes the behavior of something.

This preferably needs to be on actual hardware, and if you can, for a long period of time.

The hardware tends to be very weird and emulator is almost never enough.

I can test it too. Just don\textquotesingle{}t brink my Wii lol. \hypertarget{code_of_conduct}{}\doxysubsubsection{Code of Conduct}\label{code_of_conduct}
This file just has the general conduct when contributing to Power\+Blocks.

TL;DR don\textquotesingle{}t steel code and be mature.\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{General Tone}{General Tone}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md3}
In general be civil. Keep discussion related to Power\+Blocks.

Don\textquotesingle{}t be afraid to say I am wrong. You can call me out on my BS, and I will call you out on your BS.

Just try to be agreeable, you don\textquotesingle{}t have to name call or ad hominem go after people with dramatic comments. Just be to the point and constructive.

Provided reasoned responses and counter arguments where needed.\hypertarget{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Post Your Stuff}{Post Your Stuff}}\label{group__contributing__group_autotoc_md4}
Definitely with wii homebrew, be careful to post only your own original code. Don\textquotesingle{}t copy in code or documentation from SDKs.

When implementing functions from other code bases, just make sure that your code is unique, adds value, and is not a direct derivate work.

This also includes other media like 3D models and audio.
